# Dino Kennel

<p>Can I store my dinosaur at a loving place that will take them on an adventure, feed them, pet them, and track their health? We've all had this thought about our dinos before. This website takes care of all your worries. Using javascript, html, css, bootstrap, and jquery. This project challenged everything I've learned so far and pushed me to learn even more. I'd be lying if I said this was an easy project for me. I spent many nights up until 2am trying to make everything functional.</p>
